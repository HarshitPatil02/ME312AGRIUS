This code demonstrates the process of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a machine learning model for predicting irrigation requirements based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, crop type, wind speed, solar radiation, and soil type.

This is an example code initially considered for the finalized code.
