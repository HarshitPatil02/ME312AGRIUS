The code demonstrates the optimization of pesticide usage in agriculture by finding the optimal amounts of pesticides to minimize total usage while adhering to constraints on effectiveness and toxicity. 

It also provides visualizations to aid in understanding the feasible region and pesticide combinations.

This model couldn't be incorporated into the final draft though.
