The calculate_optimal_yield_and_pesticide() function calculates the pesticide grams required and total yield based on the difference between the maximum pH value allowed for the crop and the pH values of different cells. 

It iterates through each cell's pH value, calculates the pesticide required to adjust the pH to the maximum allowed, and accumulates the pesticide usage. 

Finally, it calculates the total yield based on the accumulated pesticide grams, considering a threshold for maximum pesticide usage.
