 The first part of the code demonstrates the optimal distribution of water across a grid to ensure each cell receives an appropriate amount based on its initial moisture content.

 The second part of the code ensures that the water distribution is optimized based on the deficit moisture in each cell, leading to more efficient use of water resources and preventing over-watering of already moist areas.
